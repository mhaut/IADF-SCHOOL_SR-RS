    "# Lanczos Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lanczos Resampling** is an advanced image resizing technique that uses sinc functions to perform high-quality interpolation. It is well-known for its ability to produce sharp and smooth images, especially when downscaling. The method utilizes a windowed sinc function to interpolate pixel values, providing better results than Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Bicubic interpolation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Original Image and Resizing:**\n",
    "   - Let $( I )$ be the original image with dimensions $( H \\times W )$ (Height Ã— Width).\n",
    "   - We aim to resize $( I )$ to a new image with dimensions $( H' \\times W' )$, where $( H' )$ and $( W' )$ are the new dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scaling Factors:**\n",
    "   - Define scaling factors $( \\alpha )$ and $( \\beta )$ for the height and width dimensions:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\alpha = \\frac{H'}{H}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\beta = \\frac{W'}{W}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - These scaling factors represent how much larger the resized image will be compared to the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pixel Mapping:**\n",
    "   - For a pixel at coordinates $( (x', y') )$ in the resized image, calculate the corresponding position in the original image:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     x = \\frac{x'}{\\alpha}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     y = \\frac{y'}{\\beta}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - $( (x, y) )$ is typically a non-integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lanczos Interpolation:**\n",
    "   - Lanczos resampling uses a sinc function windowed by a Lanczos kernel to interpolate pixel values. The sinc function is defined as:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi x}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - The Lanczos kernel function $( L(x) )$ is given by:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     L(x) = \\text{sinc}(x) \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Here, $( a )$ is the number of lobes of the Lanczos kernel (typically set to 2 or 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To compute the pixel value at $( (x', y') )$, sum the contributions from the surrounding pixels using the Lanczos kernel:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     I'(x', y') = \\sum_{i=-a}^{a} \\sum_{j=-a}^{a} L(x - i) \\cdot L(y - j) \\cdot I(x + i, y + j)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - In this formula, $( (x + i, y + j) )$ are the coordinates of the neighboring pixels in the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quality and Detail:**\n",
    "   - Lanczos resampling provides high-quality results with sharp details and smooth gradients. It is particularly effective for high-resolution and professional applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "   - It is more computationally intensive compared to Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Bicubic methods due to the calculation of the sinc function and its kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applications:**\n",
    "   - Commonly used in high-quality image editing, print media, and scenarios where preserving fine details is critical.\n",
    "\n",
